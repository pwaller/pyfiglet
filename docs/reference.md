# RichFiglet reference

The RichFiglet class is designed to be fully automatic - the only method you need to use is the constructor. Its not dynamic and cannot be modified after the fact - if you want to change the settings, you must create a new RichFiglet object.

There are 3 internal utility methods that are exposed for convenience. There's no reason you should need to use them, but they are available if you want to.
